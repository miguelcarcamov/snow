# Conda environment file for the SNOW (Self-calibration) project
# SNOW: A Python object-oriented framework for radio-interferometric self-calibration
#
# To create this environment:
#   conda env create -f environment.yml
#
# To update this environment:
#   conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
#
# To activate this environment:
#   conda activate snow-env

name: snow-env

# Channel priority: conda-forge first (more up-to-date packages), then defaults
channels:
- conda-forge
- defaults

dependencies:
  # Python version constraint
  # Note: Constrained to Python 3.10 due to CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications)
  # compatibility requirements. CASA packages may not support newer Python versions.
- python>=3.10,<3.11

  # Core scientific computing libraries
  # numpy: Fundamental package for numerical computing (pinned for CASA compatibility)
- numpy=1.26

  # System libraries
  # ncurses: Terminal control library (required by some CASA tools)
- ncurses=6.2

  # Visualization
  # matplotlib: Plotting library for data visualization
- matplotlib

  # Parallel computing
  # mpi4py: Python bindings for MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallel processing
- mpi4py

  # Package management
  # pip: Python package installer (needed to install packages from requirements.txt)
- pip

  # Pip-installed packages
  # These packages are installed via pip rather than conda because:
  # 1. CASA packages are primarily distributed via PyPI
  # 2. Some packages need specific versions that are better managed through pip
  # 3. Some packages may not be available in conda-forge
- pip:
    # Install all packages listed in requirements.txt
    # This includes CASA packages, astropy, scipy, and other dependencies
  - -r requirements.txt
